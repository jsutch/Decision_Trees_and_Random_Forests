# Decision Trees and Random Forests

Examples of Decision Teee and Random Forests with practical examples.

## Decision Trees are a type of model used for both Classification and Regression  
Trees answer sequential questions which send us down a certain route of the tree given the answer. The model behaves with “if this than that” conditions ultimately yielding a specific result.

## A Random Forest is simply a collection of decision trees whose results are aggregated into one final result. 
Their ability to limit overfitting without substantially increasing error due to bias. It's a strong modeling technique and much more robust than a single decision tree. They aggregate many decision trees to limit overfitting as well as error due to bias and therefore yield useful results.
